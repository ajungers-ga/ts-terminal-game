# TypeScript Terminal Game Lab

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was built to practice applying TypeScript fundamentals after thoroughly completing the official documentation lessons.

Itâ€™s a simple, terminal-based number guessing game. My favorite part of working with TypeScript is seeing the compiled `.js` file generated from the `.ts` source â€” I love how TypeScriptâ€™s syntax adds clarity while still producing clean, readable JavaScript under the hood.
